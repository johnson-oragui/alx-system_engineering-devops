0x0E. Web stack debugging #1

This is another of web stack debugging.
Using my debugging skills to find out 
what’s keeping my Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation 
from listening on port 80. i am allowed to install whatever tool i need, 
start and destroy as many containers as i need to debug the issue. 
Then,I write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate my fix.
